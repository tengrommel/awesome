# 6.1 What is a Tree

A tree is a data structure similar to a linked list but instead of each node pointing simply to the next node in a
 linear fashion, each node points to a number of nodes. Tree is an example of a non-linear data structure.
  
A structure is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form.
In trees ADT (Abstract Data Type), the order of the elements is not important. If we need ordering information,
linear data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, etc. can be used.
